CSS Instructions:

This theme's CSS file is located in assets/css/style.css. It is 
complied using SASS and Gulp. Hooking is up to run on your local
development environment is pretty straight forward. 

1) Clone the github repository onto your computer. I use Sourcetree.
2) Go to the Theme URI to find instructions on running Gulp to
	compile SASS files.
3) Edit in a local environment and upload the css files via FTP
